# OS-Duplex

The OS-Duplex is a dual DCC accessory decoder designed for all types of turnout drives — from traditional solenoids to motor drives and relay modules for frog polarization.  
Each side (A and B) can operate independently or be linked together.

Optional relay sockets allow you to add point frog polarization, or use the same outputs to drive extra coils or motors.
